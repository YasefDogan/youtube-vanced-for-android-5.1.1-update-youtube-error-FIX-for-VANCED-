~~This project is no longer functional.~~  
Unfortunately, YouTube Vanced for **Android 5.1.1** can no longer bypass the "Update YouTube" error, as the native YouTube app is no longer supported on Android 5.x devices.

### ✅ Recommended Alternatives
You can still enjoy YouTube on older devices using one of these alternatives:

- [**NewPipe**](https://newpipe.net) – lightweight, ad-free client supporting Android 5.0+
  

- [**Vanced Tube**](https://apkpure.com/vancedtube/com.biomes.vanced) – a YouTube client supporting Android 5.0+
- 
  ⚠️ *Disclaimer:* I am **not affiliated with** the developers or maintainers of this app, and I **cannot confirm** its origin or safety.  
  Use it at your own risk, as it may involve **security or privacy concerns**.  

  However, among the available alternatives, **Vanced Tube currently offers the closest experience to the original YouTube app**,  
  especially in terms of layout, functionality, and user interface.

I built a vanced version for android 5.1.1 that does not pop up an update youtube error. Based on youtube vanced 16.29.39 (sdk21)
-updated it wia d4n3436's modded revanced patches(22.06.2023) and youtube 16.40.36


~~!!! error 400 semi fix updated again !!!!~~
~~Actually there is a fix but also there isnt, For the videos You have to add them on a playlist( for example watch later press on the 3 down right left to text > click add to watch later > there will be a pop up saying go to list click on it> then you can play videos from the playlist) you have to play videos from the playlist, Otherwise it wont open the videos, videos in the main screen are not clickable. For now its the best i can do.~~
